##COLORS (taken from bsidesnash.org's post):
These are colors that we should keep in mind as we design the site. More discussion on how best to incorporate all the colors needs to take place. (below from bsidesnash.org)

GREEN Track is for newbie talks.  We all hear that there are not enough trained professionals. Well, let’s start growing them.  This Track is for talks targeted at those just starting out in the field, wanting to get into the field or students of technology.

RED Track is for talks focused on attacks.  Tell us about what you have been researching, what cool attack you use at work, or that crazy thing you dreamed up in Hallway-con that actually worked.

BLUE track is all about Defense.  We know attacks are sexy but the reality us most of us have to defend against attacks all day long.  This track is to talk about those defense techniques, building an Incidence Response team with nothing but 2 sticks and chewing gum and all other things defense.

PURPLE teamers we have not forgotten you, we want to hear your talks.  Please submit to the CFP.  If your talk is more attack oriented, we will call you Red if it is more Defense, Blue, if ti is straight down the middle we will find a way.
